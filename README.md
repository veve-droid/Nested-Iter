# Nested-Iter
Title: Birdâ€™s Nested Soup

Prompt the user with a menu with the following items:

First n Perfect Numbers

Factorial without using the multiplication operator

Primality Check without using the modulo operator

Exit


For item 1, ask the user to enter a positive integer, say n. Display the first n perfect numbers. Sample: n = 3, then display the first 3 perfect numbers which are: 6 28 496


For item 2, ask the user to enter a non-negative integer, say n. Compute and display the factorial n. In doing so, the use of the multiplication operator is not allowed.


For item 3, ask the user to enter a positive number, say n.  Check whether n is prime or not. The use of the modulo operator is not allowed.


For item 4, terminates the program.


Notice that at the very least, the menu has to be displayed at least once.
